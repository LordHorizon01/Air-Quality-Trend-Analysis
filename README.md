# Air Quality Trend Analysis

This project is developed as a part of our OJT (On Job Training) to understand how air quality is changing over time and what factors are actually responsible for it.

Air pollution has become one of the major environmental concerns in today’s world, especially in rapidly growing urban areas. Through this project, we aim to study different air pollutants present in the atmosphere and analyze how their concentration varies based on environmental and atmospheric conditions.

The dataset used in this project contains readings of various harmful gases such as Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Benzene, and other air quality indicators along with supporting environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and sensor responses. By analyzing this data, we try to identify patterns, trends, and possible reasons behind fluctuations in air quality levels.

Our goal is to perform a structured analysis of the data to understand:

• What pollutants are most dominant
• How environmental conditions affect pollutant levels
• When and why sudden changes in air quality occur
• Long-term trends in pollution concentration

This project helps in building a deeper understanding of real-world environmental data and the scientific reasoning behind air quality variations using data analysis techniques.
